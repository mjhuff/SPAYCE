# CodesmithSoloProject

## General Goals

1. Create a React-based site using Next.js for SSR.
2. Have a navbar on left that links to different pages...uses the cool globe library for ISS and auto load/scroll for Mars API.
3. Have users login to see their favorite saved space photos (use planetscale).
4. Use Tailwind to do the CSS.
5. D3 Animations to spruce it up.

# Landing Page

Would be cool to have some space video background (options saved to mjhuff/videos folder) and then links to the different pages.

# ISS Page (Create First)

Have the globe with ISS, people count, and the ability to click on each person's name to open up an iframe to wikipedia for their page.

# Mars Rover (Create Second)

Have Mars (Photo) Rover API. Let enter date and have paginated display, or

# Space Bodies Page (Create Third)

Maybe some cool interactive map that loads API data. You may have to hard code which bodies are selectable.
